![Step 7: Copy Link to Local PR](assets/7.%20copy%20link%20to%20local%20pr.png)

Copy the URL of your local pull request (from your fork).

#### Step 8: Add Local PR Link to Description
![Step 8: Add Local PR Link to Description](assets/8.%20put%20link%20to%20local%20pr%20into%20desciption%20to%20global%20pr.png)

Add the link to your local pull request in the description of the global pull request.

#### Step 9: Verify Everything is Correct
![Step 9: Verify Everything is Correct](assets/9.%20check%20that%20it%20is%20correct.png)

Double-check that all information is correct and complete.

#### Step 10: Copy Link to Global PR
![Step 10: Copy Link to Global PR](assets/10.%20copy%20link%20to%20global%20pr.png)

Copy the URL of your global pull request (to the base repository).

#### Step 11: Submit Link to Moodle
![Step 11: Submit Link to Moodle](assets/11.%20submit%20link%20to%20global%20pr%20into%20moodle.png)

Submit the link to your global pull request in Moodle for grading.

### Lab Branch Creation Process

#### Step 1: Create a Lab Branch
```bash
# Keep your main branch up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main

# Create a new branch for the lab
git checkout -b lab01-surname-name
```

**Branch naming convention**: `labXX-surname-name` (all lowercase, no spaces, like in Moodle)
- ‚úÖ `lab01-smith-john`
- ‚úÖ `lab03-garcia-maria`
- ‚ùå `lab01-John-Smith`
- ‚ùå `lab01_john_smith`

#### Step 2: Complete the Assignment
1. Navigate to the lab directory: `labs/labXX/`
2. Read the `README.md` for specific requirements
3. Implement both **Go backend** and **Flutter frontend** components
4. Follow the existing code style and structure

#### Step 3: Test Your Implementation
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run linting
make lint

# Test your specific lab
cd labs/labXX
# Run Go tests
cd backend && go test ./...
# Run Flutter tests  
cd ../frontend && flutter test
```

## üìù Merge Request Template

## üîç Code Review Process

### As an Author
- **Respond promptly** to review feedback
- **Address all comments** before requesting re-review
- **Test thoroughly** after making changes
- **Update documentation** if implementation changes

### As a Reviewer
Every student is expected to participate in peer reviews:

1. **Review 2-3 merge requests** from other students
2. **Focus on**:
   - Correctness and functionality
   - Code readability and style
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation quality
3. **Be constructive** and respectful
4. **Ask questions** if something is unclear
5. **Suggest improvements** rather than just pointing out problems

## üìã Code Quality Standards

### Go Backend Standards
- Follow `gofmt` formatting
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include error handling for all operations
- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Document public APIs with comments
- Follow Go conventions and idioms

### Flutter Frontend Standards  
- Follow Dart formatting (`dart format`)
- Use consistent widget structure
- Implement proper state management (Riverpod/Bloc)
- Include widget tests for UI components
- Handle loading and error states
- Follow Material Design principles

### General Standards
- **No hardcoded values** - use configuration
- **Meaningful commit messages**
- **Clear documentation** in READMEs
- **Proper error handling** throughout
- **Comprehensive test coverage**

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Failures
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make setup
make build
```

### Go Module Issues
```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
go mod download
```

### Flutter Issues
```bash
cd frontend  
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub deps
```

### Git Issues
```bash
# If your branch is behind main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main

# If you have merge conflicts
git status
# Edit conflicted files
git add .
git rebase --continue
```
